🏬 ShopNest Store – Power BI Capstone Project
Turning raw retail data into business insights with a single-page interactive Power BI dashboard.

📝 Purpose
This project demonstrates the end-to-end development of a Power BI dashboard for ShopNest Store. The goal was to transform raw datasets into an insightful, interactive, and visually compelling report that answers eight critical business questions about sales, delays, customer ratings, payments, revenue, and trends.
By consolidating multiple datasets into one integrated view, this project provides actionable insights to support marketing, operations, and strategic decision-making.

🛠 Tech Stack
Power BI Desktop – Data modeling, visualization, and DAX
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Custom measures & calculations

📂 Data Source
The project utilizes ShopNest’s e-commerce dataset, consisting of:
